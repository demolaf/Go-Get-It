## Installation

### Setup API Key
**Go Get It** requires an api key from Rapid API [Exercises DB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) which gives it rich resources of exercises a person can add to their routine.

1. Create a .env file in the root directory of your cloned copy 
2. Create a Config.xcconfig (Configuration file) in the "Go Get It" directory
3. You'll need to add a pre-action script to load your .env file into your xcconfig file
