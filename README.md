<!--## Installation-->
<!---->
<!--### Setup API Key-->
<!--**Go Get It** requires an api key from Rapid API [Exercises DB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) which gives it rich resources of exercises a person can add to their routine.-->
<!---->
<!--1. Create a .env file in the root directory of your cloned copy -->
<!--2. Create a Config.xcconfig (Configuration file) in the "Go Get It" directory-->
<!--3. You'll need to add a pre-action script to load your .env file into your xcconfig file-->
